Case Study: My Bikes Factory
My Bikes Company is a major Canadian manufacturer of bikes and bike
equipment, based in Montreal.
A bike is uniquely identified by a serial number. A bike also has the 
following information: model, color, and manufacturing year.
My Bikes Company produces two types of bikes: Mountain Bikes and 
Road Bikes. A mountain bike has its specific features, for example, the 
suspension, which can be one of these three types: front, rear, or dual.
Information regarding tires is not used for mountain bikes. A road bike
can have one of these three types of tires: regular, commuter, or gravel.
Information regarding suspension is not used for road bikes.
You have been assigned the job to design and implement a solution called 
MyBikesFactory using Visual Studio 2022 and C#.
TO DO:
• Build the Business Layer: (25%)
o Create the business classes. For each class, create the
required private fields, public properties, and constructors.
o Create the necessary enumerations (enums).
• Build the Data Layer (20%)
o Create the file handler class to load and save data to a file 
called bikes.xml.
• Build the User Interface Layer: (40%)
o Build a friendly User Interface containing the following forms:
▪ LoginForm: ask the username and password. Store the 
credentials (username and password) in a file called login.txt.
▪ MainForm: 
• Present an option to exit the application upon user 
confirmation.
• Present controls so that the user can add or update 
bikes. Specific fields should only be available to specific 
bike types, for example: suspension type to mountain 
bikes only, and tire type to road bike only.
• List Bikes: implement controls to display:
o All existing bikes (Mountain and Road Bikes). 
o Mountain Bikes only.
o Road Bikes only.
• Implement a control to search a bike by serial number. 
• Implement a control to remove an existing bike.
